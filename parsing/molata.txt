1. check syntax error
    -finish it first!

   Unmatched Quotes: If a command has an opening quote (either single ' or double "), but no matching closing quote, that's a syntax error.

   Missing Command Name: If a command starts with a special character like |, >, <, ;, etc., but there's no command name before it, that's a syntax error.

   Missing Command Arguments: Some commands require arguments. If these are missing, it's a syntax error. For example, cd with no directory name.

   Invalid Redirection: If a redirection operator (>, <, >>, 2>, etc.) is not followed by a filename, that's a syntax error.

   Invalid Pipe Usage: If a pipe operator (|) is not surrounded by commands on both sides, that's a syntax error.

   Invalid Command Chaining: If a semicolon (;) used for command chaining is not followed by a command, that's a syntax error.

   Unrecognized Command: If a command is not recognized as a built-in command or an external command, that's a syntax error.

   Invalid Variable Assignment: If a variable assignment does not follow the VARNAME=value format, that's a syntax error.

   Invalid Use of Special Characters: If special characters like *, ?, [, ], {, }, etc., are used incorrectly, that's a syntax error.

   Remember, the exact set of syntax errors you need to handle will depend on the specific requirements of your project and the syntax rules you've defined for your shell.
