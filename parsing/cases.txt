Redirection Commands: Commands that redirect input or output using >, <, >>.

Example: ls -l > output.txt
Example: cat < input.txt
Example: echo "Hello" >> output.txt
Background Commands: Commands that run in the background using &.

Example: sleep 10 &
Compound Commands: Commands combined using && or ||.

Certainly! In the context of a shell like minishell, a command typically consists of several components. Here's a breakdown of the structure of a command:

Command Name: The name of the executable or built-in command.

Example: ls, echo, grep
Arguments: Options or parameters passed to the command.

Example: -l, -a, file.txt
Redirections: Input and output redirections.

Example: >, <, >>
Example: ls > output.txt, cat < input.txt
Pipes: Used to pass the output of one command as input to another.

Example: ls -l | grep "txt"
Background Execution: Commands that run in the background.

Example: sleep 10 &
Compound Commands: Commands combined using logical operators.

Example: mkdir newdir && cd newdir
Example: make || echo "Build failed"
